data from disparate information providers into a single unified
interface. The different data sources often provide conflicting
information for the same data item. Recently, several automated
data fusion models have been proposed to resolve conflicts and
identify correct data. Although quite effective, these data fusion
models do not achieve a close-to-perfect accuracy.
We present the demonstration of a system that leverages
users as first-class citizens to confirm data conflicts and rapidly
improve the effectiveness of fusion. This demonstration is built on
solutions proposed in our previous work [1]. To utilize the user
judiciously, our system presents claims in an order that is the most
beneficial to effectiveness of fusion across data items. We describe
ranking algorithms that are built on concepts from information
theory and decision theory, and do not need access to ground
truth. We describe the user input framework and demonstrate
how conflict resolution can be expedited with minimal feedback
from the user. We show that: (a) the framework can be easily
adopted to existing data fusion models without any internal
changes to the models, and (b) the framework can integrate both
perfect and imperfect feedback from users.}

AI-based decision-making systems, allowing humans to scrutinize

probabilistic contrastive counterfactuals, a concept that can be
traced back to philosophical, cognitive, and social foundations of
theories on how humans generate and select explanations. We describe the system layout of Lewis wherein an end-user specifes
the underlying causal model and Lewis generates explanations for
particular use-cases, compares them with explanations generated
by state-of-the-art approaches in XAI, and provides actionable recourse when applicable. Lewis has been developed as open-source

conclusions. (2) Generating counterfactual explanations and recourse, where these explanations
are typically obtained by considering the smallest perturbation in an algorithm’s input that can

explaining black-box decision-making systems

fusion systems largely consider claims for a data item to be unrelated
to each other. In many domains, however, the observed claims are often
related to each other through various entity-relationships. We propose
a formalism to express entity-relationships among claims of data items
and design a framework to integrate the data relationships with existing
data fusion models to improve the effectiveness of fusion. We conducted
an experimental evaluation on real-world data, and show that the performance of fusion was significantly improved with the integration of
data relationships by (a) generating meaningful correctness probabilities for claims of data items, and (b) ensuring that the multiple correct
claims output by the fusion models were consistent with each other. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that consider the presence of relationships over claims of data items.}

of false data detection has roots in several extensively studied research areas in data management and data mining such as data
integration, data cleaning, crowdsourcing and machine learning.
Specifically, detection of false data has significant overlap with data
fusion, an active area of research in data integration that focuses on
distinguishing correct from incorrect information in a structured

AuthIntegrate, an end-to-end system that ingests conflicting data

Gopher, a system that produces compact, interpretable, and causal

coherent subsets of the training data that are root-causes for this behavior. Specifically, we introduce the concept ofcausal responsibility

on this concept, we develop an efficient approach for generating

from the machine learning (ML) community to approximate causal

year = {2017},
abstract = {In domains such as the Web, sensor networks and social media, sources often provide conflicting information for the same data item. Several data fusion techniques have been proposed recently to resolve conflicts and identify correct data. The performance of these fusion systems, while quite accurate, is far from perfect. In this paper, we propose to leverage user feedback for validating data conflicts and rapidly improving the performance of fusion. To present the most beneficial data items for the user to validate, we take advantage of the level of consensus among sources, and the output of fusion to generate an effective ordering of items. We first evaluate data items individually, and then define a novel decision-theoretic framework based on the concept of value of perfect information (VPI) to order items by their ability to boost the performance of fusion. We further derive approximate formulae to scale up the decision-theoretic framework to large-scale data. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world datasets with different characteristics, and show that the accuracy of fusion can be significantly improved even while requesting feedback on a few data items. We also show that the performance of the proposed methods depends on the characteristics of data, and assess the trade-off between the amount of feedback acquired, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the methods.},
