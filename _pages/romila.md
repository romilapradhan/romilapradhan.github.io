I am an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a> in the <a href="https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/departments/computer-and-information-technology">Department of Computer and Information Technology</a>, and a faculty affiliate at the <a href="https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/">Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS)</a>.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/">Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute</a> in the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California San Diego</a>, and a Visiting Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at Purdue University. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University and graduated with M.S. and B.S. in Mathematics and Computing from the <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur</a>, India.

My research is supported by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2237149">NSF CAREER Award</a>, a <a href="https://casmi.northwestern.edu/research/projects/data-biases.html">CASMI research grant</a>, and a <a href="https://research.google/outreach/research-scholar-program/recipients/?category=2022">Google Research Scholar Award</a>.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My reseach lies in the broad area of data management and data science. My current research is in the area of responsible data science that is aimed at developing systems that enable explainability, fairness, and accountability of data-driven decision-making systems. I am also interested in ensuring that the data input to different data analytics tasks is of the highest quality. Toward that end, I have worked on problems in data integration, focusing on resolving conflicts in data integrated from disparate data sources and ensuring that users of a conflict resolution system can trust the quality of the integrated data.
