<b><u>Project Summary</u>:</b> Machine learning systems are increasingly being used in a variety of data science applications that involve automated decision-making. While learning-enabled systems have the potential to eliminate some undesirable aspects of human decision-making, they are known to reinforce systemic biases and discrimination reflected in their training data. This project will develop novel technologies to realize the potential of robust, fair, and explainable data-driven decision-making systems. Toward this goal, the project centers on data preparation and debugging techniques to ensure that the underlying training data and data handling processes are devoid of unexpected errors. Comprehensive and efficient solutions that demonstrate the importance of data quality as a tool for understanding and debugging undesired behavior of data science applications will be developed.
